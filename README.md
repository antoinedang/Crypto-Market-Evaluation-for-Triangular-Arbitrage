INSTRUCTIONS:

 > Change the exchanges in arbitrage_bot.py, near the top, to indicate which exchanges the evaluation should be performed on. (NOTE: more exchanges takes longer, meaning less data points per exhange)
 > run arbitrage_bot.py to fetch market data from the defined exchanges, detect arbitrage oppurtunities (a series of exchanges), and evaluate potential profit. (see log.txt and profitable_exchanges.txt to see results)
 > run assess.py to assess the performance of each exchange individually and the overall performance of the bot. (will generate detailed assessment.txt file)


This project was designed and programmed entirely by me (Antoine Dangeard) as a side project throughout winter vacation (20th December '21 to 4th January '22).

This is the public version, I will be moving to a private version for any further changes. (which requires api keys/credentials for some exchanges)
